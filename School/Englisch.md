In the short film „Balance“ are 5 people on a platform that has to be balanced. If one person takes a step, the others have to move in the opposite direction to correct the weight imbalance. They all step to the edge of the platform and begin to fish in the void. One person pulls out a big crate so everyone else has to balance the platform again. The person who caught the crate tries to open it but another person shifts the balance of the platform in a way, so that the crate slides to his feet. The other people begin to do the same, leading to on person sitting on the crate and knocking the other people of the platform. In the end the box is sitting opposite to the last person on the platform so he isn’t able to move.

Outline

Chinese parenting 
- strict, many rules 
- punishment, shaming (think children are tough enough to withstand)
- high expectations 
- kids in debt to parents
- know what’s best for their children
- choose hobbies and interest for children
- nothing worse than A
western parenting
- worried about their children’s psyche
- praise even on a B- 

In her book “Battle hymn of a tiger mother” from 2011, Amy Chua writes about Chinese parenting in comparison to western parenting. 
The Author of the book explains Chinese parenting as very strict with many regulation.  E.g. one of the regulations states that children aren’t allowed to have a play date.
Another aspect of Chinese parenting are the high expectations the parents have in their children, an example for that would be, that Chinese children aren’t allowed to get anything worse than an A where as western children often still get praised even if they get a B-. In general Chinese parents think that in order to become good at something and have fun, you have to work hard for it.  
Chinese parents are also keen on punishing or shaming their child for bad grades wich western parents would do because they tend to be concerned about their children’s psyche and mental health as well as their physical health. 
Those high expectations have their origin in the belief that the Chinese children are in debt to their parents. Additionally that’s probably the reason for Chinese parents picking the hobbies, interests and free time activities. 
But the Author also states that for the Chinese parenting style the parents need fortitude because the children will resist.  
If Amy parents hadn’t been strict, she wouldn’t have been a successful professor.
If Sophia and Louisa read their mothers book, they’d probably understand her better.
If I was Louisa, I’d be mad at my mum.

## Arguments 

- Those people who made their dream come true, make headlines. The thousands who don't succeed go unnoticed
- Statistics showed that compared to other countries social mobility in the USA is rather limited
	- Mobility actuary lower than in Europe

Arguments against the statement that "the American Dream is still alive" include:

1. Economic Inequality: Many argue that economic inequality has widened, making it increasingly difficult for lower-income individuals to achieve upward mobility.
2. Decline in Social Mobility: Studies suggest that social mobility in the United States has stagnated or declined, indicating that not everyone has an equal opportunity to achieve the American Dream.
3. Rising Costs: The rising costs of education, healthcare, and housing can make it challenging for individuals to achieve financial stability and upward mobility.
4. Racial Disparities: Persistent racial disparities in areas such as income, education, and homeownership suggest that not everyone has equal access to the opportunities necessary to achieve the American Dream.
5. Decline in Homeownership: Homeownership, often seen as a key component of the American Dream, has declined, particularly among younger generations facing high housing costs and stagnant wages.
