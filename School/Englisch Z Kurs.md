	- He was unsure about his job choice and he wasn’t just able to apply for any job.
	- His father had connections wich gave him the choice between watchmaker, goldsmith or optician, but even those tried to reject him.
- There were no watchmaker apprenticeships before, but at his time that option became available, which he took.
- 3 Years into the apprenticeship, he got his high-school diploma in evening school.
- He didn’t enjoy his job as a watchmaker.
- Later he got drafted and served his time in the NVA.
- After the army service he wanted to go to a university but didn’t want to apply through the central application station in Magdeburg because they would have rejected him because of his political opinion.

- He got his diploma in engineering and worked as an engineer for a year after which he quit as well. 
- After that he was unemployed for 2 years.
